Thanks to Kevin Reed at TNETWeather, we now have two new sets of arrows 
included in the distribution.
  *-sm.gif - are 9x9 arrows with transparent background 
  *.gif - are 14x14 arrows with transparent background (replaces original set)
  the backgrounds are anti-aliased with the background color of the SWN mesomap
  graphic.
